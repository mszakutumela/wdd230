        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <h3>Site Name: Tshwane Chamber of Commerce</h3>
        <p>The chamber operates in the city of Tshwane (Pretoria), South Africa. The jacaranda tree is one of the major symbols of the city. Jacaranda trees are native to South America and first came to Tshwane (Pretoria) in 1888. A travelling nurseryman called Templeman sold two Jacaranda seedlings to Jacob Cilliers, who resided at Myrtle Lodge in Tshwane (Pretoria). A plaque was also placed at the site to commemmorate the event. The plaque was unveiled on, 8 November 1939. It is said that many of the jacaranda trees in the city originated from these two seedlings.</p>
