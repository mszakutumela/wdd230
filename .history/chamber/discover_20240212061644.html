        <h3>Melrose House</h3>
        <p>
            Melrose House, a National Monument, offers visitors the experience of stepping back in time to the late 19th century. 
            Built in 1866 by wealthy businessman George J. Heys, this handsome Victorian house was where the Treaty of Vereeniging, 
            the Peace Treaty terminating the Anglo Boer War, was signed in 1902.

            Sitting on Salvokop Hill with panoramic views, Freedom park traces the story of South Africa's liberation and honors those who played an important role. 
            The site opened to the public in 2007 and encompasses a series of poignant memorials and an impressive museum with exhibits examining the nation's history

        <h3>Union Buildings</h3>
        <p>
            Set in beautiful gardens, the Union Buildings command the highest point of the city on Meintjieskop Hill near historic Church Square, site 
            of the city's first settlement. Designed by Sir Herbert Baker in 1913, this impressive range of sandstone buildings mixes Italian Renaissance, 
            English Renaissance, and Cape Dutch styles. It's the seat of government and also houses the offices of the president and the state archives.

        <h3>Voortrekker Monument</h3>
        <p>
            High on a hilltop south of the city center, the Voortrekker Monument is a South African National Heritage site and one of the country's most visited 
            historic monuments. It was built in 1949 to commemorate the Voortrekkers, the Boers who pushed northward into unknown territory in the mid 19th-century.

This 40-meter-high square granite structure is a prominent landmark in the city with steps leading up to the Hall of Heroes, where 27 marble reliefs depict the Great Trek of 1838. Surrounding the monument is a wall depicting ox-wagons representing the trek wagons. On 16 December each year, a shaft of sunlight shines through an opening in the dome and illuminates a cenotaph below, which reads. "Ons vir jou, Suid-Afrika" ("We are for you, South Africa").
